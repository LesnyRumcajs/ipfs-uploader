Ideas to further improve this project:
- [ ] store CID as raw bytes to save space
- [ ] make server addresses configurable (so far it's localhost restricted)
- [ ] consider including the contract ABI statically (less flexibility, possibly better UX because of portability, less runtime overhead).
- [ ] more elaborate error handling
- [ ] input validation
- [ ] consider more corner cases
